# Semantic-Image-Segmentation-

## General project idea
Semantic Image segmentation seeks to label the pixels in an image with a particular class label. This differs from instance segmentation as instance segmentation seeks to separate each instance of the class while semantic segmentation doesn’t inherently distinguish between instances of a class. Eg, when examining a picture of person riding bicycle, semantic segmentation would classify both ‘person’ and 'byiycle'.

## Dataset
The PASCAL VOC[3] (Visual Object Classes) in 2012 dataset is large-scale object detection, segmentation, key-point detection, and captioning dataset. The Datasets for this project, we considered the training set of 1,968 images, the Validation set of 216 Images, and the testing set of 168 Images. For class indices for VOC labels, there are 21 colormaps for segmentation classes and 21 segmentation objects.

## Instructions to run the code:
1) open the notebook in google golab with the link avilable on top of the file "Semantic_Segmentaion_Pascal_Voc_Final.ipynb".
2) Connect to GPU 
3) Run the notebook
